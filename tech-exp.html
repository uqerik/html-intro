      <p>My web development journey began way back in 2021, during that period, all I had was an android phone and a big dream. Learning with a phone wasn't easy believe me, navigating from your tutorial to code editor to tutorial again and back was not just stressful it's frustrating. As a result, I felt like I was going in circles more often than moving forward.</p><br>

      <p>Things took a positive turn the following year when I managed to acquire a laptop. I thought that was the breakthrough I needed but it wasn't. Despite having better tools, I lacked direction and professional guidance. The tutorials I found were either too scattered and unfocused or too limited. None wasn't just right. My passion was alive, but my growth was stalled by confusion and my very own inconsistency. lol</p><br>

      <p>At the beginning of 2025, I made a bold promise to myself: this year won't end without me becoming a web developer. I approached that goal with fierce determination, like a bull charging at a matador. I restarted my learning with renewed focus and discipline. But what truly changed everything was stumbling upon the <a href="https://genesystechub.com">Genesys Upskill </a>program. That was my 'aha' moment. It wasn't just another tutorial; it was a structured path that walked with me step by step, showing me exactly what to learn, how to learn it, and why it mattered</p><br>

      <p>What set Genesys Upskill apart was the precision. It wasn't about throwing information at me it was about building a solid foundation. I finally felt like I wasn't just learning to code, I was becoming a developer. With their guidance and my 100% commitment, I now see web development not as a distant goal, but as a rapidly unfolding reality. The sky isn't the limit anymore, it's the starting point.</p>
      <p>But enough about me let's your hear own story.</p>
